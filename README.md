# Demand Forecasting: "How Many Potatoes Are We Selling Tomorrow?"

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the demand for products, such as potatoes, by analyzing various factors that influence sales. Using time series forecasting techniques, the model provides insights into future demand, helping companies manage inventory, plan for seasonal changes, and respond to market trends effectively.

## Models and Techniques (Final Model types TBD)

- **Time Series Analysis**
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **XGBoost**
- **Prophet Model**

These models are tested and evaluated to identify the most accurate approach for demand forecasting.

## Goal

The goal is to predict the quantity of a given product that a company will sell, factoring in variables like seasonality, events, and weather conditions. This allows for more informed decision-making in inventory and supply chain management.

## Dataset

## 10-Day Plan

1. **Days 1-4**: Data Collection and Cleaning & EDA  
   - Gather and preprocess the dataset, handling any missing values or inconsistencies.
   - Explore and visualize the dataset to understand trends, seasonality, and key features that impact demand.
   
2. **Days 5-6**: Model Selection and Baseline Forecasting  
   - Experiment with various forecasting models to establish a baseline performance.

3. **Days 7-8**: Model Tuning and Evaluation  
   - Fine-tune the selected models to optimize accuracy and assess performance against the baseline.

4. **Day 9**: Comparative Analysis of Models  
   - Compare the performance of different models to identify the best approach for forecasting.

5. **Day 10**: Documentation and Final Report  
   - Document findings, prepare visualizations, and summarize insights in a report.
